🤖 Retinitis Pigmentosa Q&A Assistant using LangChain & RAG
This repository implements a domain-specific Q&A Assistant for Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) using LangChain and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). It allows users to ask natural language questions and receive intelligent, context-aware answers based on RP-related documents.

🧠 Project Objective
Build an intelligent assistant to answer questions about Retinitis Pigmentosa using a combination of document retrieval and language modeling.

Use LangChain to manage document loading, embedding, retrieval, and LLM response generation.

Apply RAG architecture to enhance factual accuracy by grounding the model's responses in real medical data.

🔍 Key Technologies
LangChain: For chaining together components like document loaders, vector stores, and LLMs.

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): To combine search (retrieval) with text generation for more accurate Q&A.

OpenAI / HuggingFace Transformers: For the language model backend.

FAISS / ChromaDB: For vector similarity search and retrieval.

📁 Files Included
File/Notebook	Description
RP_Q&Aassistant.ipynb	Main notebook implementing the LangChain RAG pipeline for question answering about RP.

⚙️ How It Works
Document Ingestion: Load RP-related medical articles or notes.

Embedding: Convert text into numerical vectors using embedding models.

Retrieval: Use similarity search (FAISS/Chroma) to fetch the most relevant documents.

Generation: Pass retrieved context + question to an LLM (via LangChain) to generate an answer.

🧪 Example Use
Question: What are the early symptoms of Retinitis Pigmentosa?
Answer (Generated): Early symptoms often include difficulty seeing at night and loss of peripheral vision, progressing to tunnel vision over time.
